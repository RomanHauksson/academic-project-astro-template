This is a template you can use to create a simple project page for your research paper. See a live demo [here](https://research-template.roman.technology).

## Features

- Polished, quick-to-load, responsive, accessible, and SEO-friendly template adapted from the original [Nerfies page](https://nerfies.github.io/).
- Easily edit in Markdown instead of HTML.
- Includes out-of-the-box components for the header, figures, LaTeX equations, two-column layouts, code blocks (with syntax highlighting), small caps, videos, and YouTube embeds.
- Add custom components using HTML or even other web frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte.
- Built with modern web development tools like [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Usage

Need help setting it up? Please schedule a call with me [here](https://cal.com/romanhauksson/meeting), and I'll personally walk you through making your project page live! I want to talk to potential users to figure out pain points and features to add.

1. Click "Use this template" to make a copy of this repository and then clone it, or just clone it directly.
2. Run `npm install` from the root of the project to install dependencies.
3. Edit the content in `/src/pages/index.mdx`, and remember to update the favicon at `/public/favicon.svg` and the social link thumbnail at `/public/thumbnail.png`.
4. Run `npm run dev` to see a live preview of your page while you edit it.
5. Host the website using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or any other static site hosting service.

## Notes

- If you're using VS Code, I recommend installing the [Astro extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astro-build.astro-vscode) to get IntelliSense, syntax highlighting, and other features.
- The Nerfies page uses the Google Sans font, which is licensed by Google, so unfortunately, I had to change it to a different font instead (I picked Noto Sans).
