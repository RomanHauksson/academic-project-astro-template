# The color theme of the page. Defaults to "device" (the preference set in the user's brower or operating system). Setting this to "light" or "dark" will override the user's preference. This is useful if your figures only look good in one theme.
theme: device

# This is the icon that appears in the user's browser tab. To customize, change the favicon.svg file in /public/, or add your own file to /public/ and change the filename here.
favicon: favicon.svg

# These keys are optional. If a link to your project page is in a Google search result, text message, or social media post, it will often appear as a "link preview card" based on its title, description, favicon, and thumbnail. After you publish your page, you can double check that these previews look right using [this tool](https://linkpreview.xyz/)

## Abstract

This is a template you can use to create a professional project page for your research paper. [See the code for the template and instructions on how to use it yourself on GitHub](https://github.com/RomanHauksson/academic-project-astro-template). It's made with the [Astro web framework](https://astro.build/) and styled with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). You write the content in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which enables markdown formatting like **bold**, _italics_, and ~strikethrough~, as well as custom components like <SmallCaps>small caps.</SmallCaps>

</HighlightedSection>

## Visuals

### Picture

Use the `Picture` component to display images. If you have a figure in PDF format, you can pass in its path as the `src` prop and it will be converted into a web-friendly image automatically.

<Picture src={dogsDiffc} alt="Photo of two running dogs, lossily compressed using the DiffC algorithm" />

### Wide visual

I constrained the maximum width of the text column to make sure it's readable even when the screen is wide. But images and other visuals should "break out" and take up more horizontal space: for this, try wrapping them in the `Wide` component.

<Wide>
  <Picture src={dogsDiffc} alt="Photo of two running dogs, lossily compressed using the DiffC algorithm" />
</Wide>

### Figure with caption

Wrap a visual in a `Figure` component to add a caption.

<Figure>
  <Picture slot="figure" src={dogsDiffc} alt="Photo of two running dogs, lossily compressed using the DiffC algorithm" />
  <Fragment slot="caption">A photo of two dogs running side-by-side in shallow water, lossily compressed using the [DiffC algorithm](https://jeremyiv.github.io/diffc-project-page/).</Fragment>
</Figure>

### Comparison slider

Use the `Comparison` component to compare two visuals with an interactive slider.

<Comparison client:idle >
  <Picture slot="itemOne" src={dogsDiffc} alt="Photo of two running dogs, lossily compressed using the DiffC algorithm" />
  <Picture slot="itemTwo" src={dogsTrue} alt="True photo of two dogs running side-by-side in shallow water" />
</Comparison>

### Tab panels

Tab panels are a great way to display a labeled collection of related visuals without taking up too much space.

<Tabs defaultValue="true">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="true">Ground truth</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="diffc">DiffC (Flux-dev)</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="msillm">MS-ILLM</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="true">
    <Picture
      src={dogsTrue}
      alt="True photo of two dogs running side-by-side in shallow water"
    />
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="diffc">
    <Picture
      src={dogsDiffc}
      alt="Photo of two running dogs, lossily compressed using the DiffC algorithm"
    />
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="msillm">
    <Picture
      src={dogsMsillm}
      alt="Photo of two running dogs, lossily compressed using MS-ILLM"
    />
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

### Carousel

A carousel is another useful pattern for a collection of visuals that don't necessarily have meaningful labels.

<Carousel>
  <CarouselSlide>
    <Picture src={dogsTrue} alt="True photo of two dogs running side-by-side in shallow water" />
  </CarouselSlide>
  <CarouselSlide>
    <Picture src={dogsDiffc} alt="Photo of two running dogs, lossily compressed using the DiffC algorithm" />
  </CarouselSlide>
  <CarouselSlide>
    <Picture
      src={dogsMsillm}
      alt="Photo of two running dogs, lossily compressed using MS-ILLM"
    />
  </CarouselSlide>
</Carousel>

## Two columns

Use the two columns component to display two columns of content. In this example, the first column contains a YouTube video embed and the second column contains an interactive 3D model viewer. By default, they display side by side, but if the screen is narrow enough (for example, on mobile), they're arranged vertically.

<TwoColumns>
  <YouTubeVideo slot="left" videoId="wjZofJX0v4M" />
  <ModelViewer slot="right" src="/BoxVertexColors.glb" alt="A cube colored with a rainbow gradient" />
</TwoColumns>

## $\LaTeX$

You can also add $\LaTeX$ formulas, rendered during the build process using [$\KaTeX$](https://katex.org/) so they're quick to load for visitors of your project page. You can write them inline, like this: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Or, you can write them as a block:

$$
\int_a^b f(x) dx
$$

## Citation

If you copy your bibliography into `./bibliography.bib`, you can cite papers using their BibTeX keys, and they'll be automatically formatted and included in the bibliography section at the end. For example: [@vaswani2017attention]. Note that these citations are distinct from footnotes[^mynote], which show up in a separate section if you use them.

[^mynote]: On the web, they should really be called "endnotes", since each page constitutes a full document.

## Table

Add simple tables using [GitHub Flavored Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables):

| Model | Accuracy | F1 score | Training time (hours) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| BERT-base | 0.89 | 0.87 | 4.5 |
| RoBERTa-large | 0.92 | 0.91 | 7.2 |
| DistilBERT | 0.86 | 0.84 | 2.1 |
| XLNet | 0.90 | 0.89 | 6.8 |

## BibTeX citation

Displaying the BibTeX entry for your paper in a code block makes it easy to copy and paste.

```bibtex
@misc{roman2024academic,
  author = "{Roman Hauksson}",
  title = "Academic Project Page Template",
  year = "2024",
  howpublished = "\url{https://research-template.roman.technology}",
}
```
