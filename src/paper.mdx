# The color theme of the page. Defaults to "device" (the preference set in the user's brower or operating system). Setting this to "light" or "dark" will override the user's preference. This is useful if your figures only look good in one theme.
theme: device

# This is the icon that appears in the user's browser tab. To customize, change the favicon.svg file in /public/, or add your own file to /public/ and change the filename here.
favicon: favicon.svg

# These keys are optional. If a link to your project page is in a Google search result, text message, or social media post, it will often appear as a "link preview card" based on its title, description, favicon, and thumbnail. After you publish your page, you can double check that these previews look right using [this tool](https://linkpreview.xyz/)

## Abstract

This is a live demo for a template you can use to create a simple project page for your research paper. See the code for the template and instructions on how to use it yourself [here](https://github.com/RomanHauksson/academic-project-astro-template). It's made with the [Astro web framework](https://astro.build/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). You write the content in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which enables markdown formatting like **bold**, _italics_, and ~strikethrough~, as well as custom components like <SmallCaps>small caps.</SmallCaps>

</HighlightedSection>

## Figures

Use the figure component to display images, videos, equations, or any other element, with an optional caption.

<Figure>
  <Picture slot="figure" src={transformer} alt="Diagram of the transformer deep learning architecture." invertInDarkMode />
  <Fragment slot="caption">Diagram of the transformer deep learning architecture.</Fragment>
</Figure>

If you stored your figures as PDFs, the `Picture` component can convert them into web-friendly images automatically.

<Figure>
  <Picture slot="figure" src="../assets/allstate-sparsity.pdf" alt="Impact of the sparsity-aware algorithm in XGBoost on the Allstate-10K dataset." invertInDarkMode />
  <Fragment slot="caption">Impact of the sparsity-aware algorithm in [XGBoost](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754) on the Allstate-10K dataset.</Fragment>
</Figure>

Use the `Comparison` component to compare two elements with an interactive slider. It should work for any component or HTML element, including images, videos, and 3D models.

<Figure>
  <Comparison slot="figure" client:idle >
    <Picture slot="itemOne" src={dogsDiffc} alt="Photo of two dogs running side-by-side in shallow water, lossily compressed using the DiffC algorithm" />
    <Picture slot="itemTwo" src={dogsTrue} alt="Original photo of two dogs running side-by-side in shallow water" />
  </Comparison>
  <Fragment slot="caption">A photo of two dogs running side-by-side in shallow water, lossily compressed using the [DiffC algorithm](https://jeremyiv.github.io/diffc-project-page/).</Fragment>
</Figure>

## Two columns

Use the two columns component to display two columns of content. In this example, the first column contains a figure with a YouTube video and the second column contains a figure with a custom [React](https://react.dev/) component. By default, they display side by side, but if the screen is narrow enough (for example, on mobile), they're arranged vertically.

<TwoColumns>
  <Figure slot="left">
    <YouTubeVideo slot="figure" videoId="wjZofJX0v4M" />
    <Fragment slot="caption">Take a look at this YouTube video.</Fragment>
  </Figure>
  <Figure slot="right">
    <ModelViewer slot="figure" src="/BoxVertexColors.glb" alt="A cube colored with a rainbow gradient" />
    <Fragment slot="caption">Now look at this cube, rendered with the `<model-viewer>` web component.</Fragment>
  </Figure>
</TwoColumns>

## LaTeX

You can also add LaTeX formulas, rendered during the build process using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) so they're quick to load for visitors of your project page. You can write them inline, like this: <LaTeX inline formula="a^2 + b^2 = c^2" />. Or, you can write them as a block:

<LaTeX formula="\int_a^b f(x) dx" />

## Tables

Add simple tables using [GitHub Flavored Markdown syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables):

| Model | Accuracy | F1 score | Training time (hours) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| BERT-base | 0.89 | 0.87 | 4.5 |
| RoBERTa-large | 0.92 | 0.91 | 7.2 |
| DistilBERT | 0.86 | 0.84 | 2.1 |
| XLNet | 0.90 | 0.89 | 6.8 |

## BibTeX citation

Displaying your BibTeX citation in a code block makes it easy to copy and paste.

```bibtex
@misc{roman2024academic,
  author = "{Roman Hauksson}",
  title = "Academic Project Page Template",
  year = "2024",
  howpublished = "\url{https://research-template.roman.technology}",
}
```
