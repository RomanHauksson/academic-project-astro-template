# The color theme of the page. Defaults to "device" (the preference set in the user's brower or operating system). Setting this to "light" or "dark" will override the user's preference. This is useful if your figures only look good in one theme.
theme: light

# This is the icon that appears in the user's browser tab. To customize, change the favicon.svg file in /public/, or add your own file to /public/ and change the filename here.

# These keys are optional. If a link to your project page is in a Google search result, text message, or social media post, it will often appear as a "link preview card" based on its title, description, favicon, and thumbnail. After you publish your page, you can double check that these previews look right using [this tool](https://linkpreview.xyz/)
